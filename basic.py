    # 2. We can create as many cursors as we want from a single connection object. Cursors created from the same connection are not isolated,
    #    ****i.e., any changes done to the database by a cursor are immediately visible by the other cursors!!!****
    # 3. Cursors are not thread-safe.

    # After this, we printed PostgreSQL Connection properties using a connection.get_dsn_parameters().
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    # Print PostgreSQL Connection properties
    print(connection.get_dsn_parameters(), "\n")

    # Print PostgreSQL version
    #  #cursor.execute()
    # Using the cursorâ€™s execute method we can execute a database operation or query.
    # Execute method takes a SQL query as a parameter.
    # We can retrieve query result using cursor methods such as fetchone(), fetchmany(), fetcthall().
